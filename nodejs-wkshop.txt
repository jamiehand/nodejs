- We're going to make a fully functioning web server using Node! :)
- Client - Chrome, Firefox, etc. - no need to write one.
- Server - What we need to write. - responds to HTTP requests.
- Node comes with package manager -> install dependencies; external code that
  we'll use in new projects to build on someone else's code.
    - npm - node package manager
$ npm init
- Entry point: for where it starts
$ npm install express --save
    - "save" automatically puts it into the package.json
    - express helps set up a web server quickly
- templating: using a template
    - use 'pug' formerly known as jade
- npm install -g nodemon  // monitors for changes in code

- Every page I render is a 'view'
- TODO add postgres.app to my path for psql

- postgres: can't make a table called user
- postgres is a db engine: uses something more efficient than HTTP to
  manage something more
- db's are the essence of dynamic websites
- open postgres: CREATE DATABASE middleendian_demo;

- back in terminal: $ knex init
- knex helps us connect to our db
- $ knex migrate:make initial
    - by default knex uses the development environment
    - We can manually create the schema for our DB, but it can get complicated
      quickly.
    - schema describes fields of my table
    - e.g. table "Course"
        - columns: id, name, code
    - schema is created through sql commands
        - e.g. CREATE TABLE 'course' (
            int 'id'
            char(200) 'name'
            char(200) 'code'
        )
    - nice to codify these using migrations! :)
    - knex.schema.createTable('course', function(table){
        ...
    })

- docs for knex --> knexjs.org
- knex migrate:latest
- finding the name of my db: open psgl:
    - \l   <-- lists all dbs in my instance of postgresql
    - \c middleendian_demo  <-- connect to middleendian_demo db
    - \dt  <-- list all tables in this db

- save name of environment in env
- see callbackhell for what it looks like w/o promises

- npm install --save body-parser

- NOTE: if I change the view I don't need to restart my server b/c it's just
  taking the view and serving it.
